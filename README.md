# gemini-rag-chatbot
A Streamlit-based RAG Chatbot powered by Google Gemini API, with support for uploading PDF/TXT files as a knowledge base, semantic search, and interactive Q&amp;A

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using Streamlit and Googleâ€™s Gemini API.

âœ¨ Key Features:

Gemini API Integration â€“ Uses google.generativeai for intelligent text generation.

Custom Knowledge Base â€“ Upload multiple PDF or TXT files that the chatbot can reference.

Semantic Search â€“ Implements a simple keyword-based search to fetch relevant knowledge base chunks for context.

RAG Pipeline â€“ Combines retrieved context with the userâ€™s query to generate accurate, context-aware answers.

Interactive UI â€“ Clean chat interface with support for chat history, clearing KB, and customizable AI settings.

Configurable Parameters â€“ Adjust model type, temperature, and max tokens from the sidebar.

Dark-Themed Styling â€“ Custom CSS applied for a polished, minimal UI.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

Streamlit â€“ Interactive web UI

Google Generative AI (Gemini API) â€“ Text generation

PyPDF (pypdf) â€“ PDF text extraction

Tempfile & OS â€“ Secure file handling

Python typing â€“ Type annotations for cleaner code

ðŸ’¡ This project demonstrates how to combine document retrieval with generative AI to build intelligent assistants that can reason over custom knowledge bases.
